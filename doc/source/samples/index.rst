Samples
=======

Samples are a great way to learn about MassTransit features. By seeing a feature used in a working 
application, it makes it easier to explore and understand. A developer can clone the repository, open
the solution in Visual Studio, and walk through the code.

The new samples are standalone repositories, which use NuGet to pull dependencies exactly as a developer
would use MassTransit.

The samples are described in the following sections.
